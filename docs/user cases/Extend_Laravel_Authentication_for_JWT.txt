### Summary:

- The provided steps cover the extension of Laravel authentication for JWT, including registration, login, profile update, profile view, and logout.
- Expected outcomes, errors, and logs are defined for each step to ensure proper functionality.
- Rate limiting is implemented to enhance security and prevent abuse.
- Careful consideration is given to potential missing user cases to handle edge scenarios effectively.
